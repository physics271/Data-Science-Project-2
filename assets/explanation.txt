An old story about Wikipedia is that clicking the first link on any page repeatedly will ultimately lead you to Philosophy. However, what about the second or third link?

Wikipedia-dia attempts to answer this question. Using the controls above, you can see the network generated by repeatedly clicking the n-th link starting from random Wikipedia pages. 

The colors in the above network distinguish the different connected components (i.e. the groups of pages that all end up in the same place eventually).
Hexagonal nodes are all part of a cycle, meaning they eventually loop back to themself. On the other hand, circular nodes are not part of cycles (though they all eventually lead to a cycle).
